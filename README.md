# Fraud detection using Self-Organizing Maps and Artificial Neural Networks

##### Return a list of potential fraudulent customers using Self-Organizing maps
##### Plug these results into a supervised learning model to obtain probabilities of these customers
##### Requires identifying patterns (Customer Segmentation) in a high dimensional dataset full of non-linear relationships
##### Dataset used: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/statlog+(australian+credit+approval)
##### The dataset contains information about customers applying for an advanced credit card
